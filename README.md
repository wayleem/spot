# **SPOT**

### **HIDE AND SEEK ROBLOX GAME**

The game is based off of Hide and Seek and follows the same goal. The Seeker is aiming to find and catch all the hiders whereas the Hider is trying to evade the Seeker. Ironically, the Seeker is a "blind" light as the Seeker is portrayed as a beam of light that moves around the game. Based on this, the Seeker cannot see any Hiders outside of their light. Hiders are rendered invisible/not rendered at all outside of their range. 

SPOT stands away from Hide and Seek through its unique mechanics and functionalities. A win condition is added for the hiders where instead of waiting for a time window for the seekers to catch all the hiders, the hiders are the ones under a time constraint to complete outlined objectives to escape. This is not a linear task as they have to do this while evading capture of the seeker, and it does not help the fact that hiders are in a sound producing environment. That being said, hiders can unintentionally produce sound cues for the seeker to get a gist of their location. This jeopardizes the hiders as the hiders also have a disadvantage of being slower than the seeker.

## **Rules & Mechanics**

- SPOT follows the same objective of Hide and Seek. The seeker aims to try to find all the hiders while the hiders try to conceal themselves.

- Hider have an additional objective, in order to win, they must escape. An escape window is only opened after completing a list of objectives such as activation of certain switches.

- Since SPOT is digital, it does not have to follow conventional rules that are restricted by being a physical game. Unlike hide and seek, the hiders visibly do not render for the seeker unless they are within the lightâ€™s range.

## **Balancing**

- Since the seeker is handicapped with its impaired perception, the seeker is able to traverse the map by hovering through whereas the Hider has to physically walk through the map.

- Seekers also have a higher walkspeed than hiders.

- Certain parts of the environment generates sounds which hiders can unintentionally produce to alert the seeker of their location

- There is a side objective that allows the hiders to temporarily disable the seeker. Similarly to the switches from the main objective, certain switches also exist that upon completion shuts down the seeker for a couple seconds, giving the hiders a grace period.
